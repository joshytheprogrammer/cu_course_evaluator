# CU Course Evaluator

## Purpose

The CU Course Evaluator is a browser extension designed to simplify the course evaluation process for students at Covenant University. Instead of manually filling out a lengthy form with numerous items, students can now express their evaluation by selecting a mood (Positive or Negative). The extension automates the form-filling process based on the chosen mood, saving time and effort for the students.

- **Rating Selection:** Students can choose between Positive and Negative ratings to indicate their overall evaluation sentiment.

- **Automated Form Filling:** The extension automatically populates the course evaluation form with predefined responses based on the selected mood.
