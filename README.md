# CU Course Evaluator

## Purpose

The CU Course Evaluator is a browser extension designed to simplify the course evaluation process for students at Covenant University. Instead of manually filling out a lengthy form with numerous items, students can now express their evaluation by selecting a mood (Positive or Negative). The extension automates the form-filling process based on the chosen mood, saving time and effort for the students.

## Features

- **Rating Selection:** Students can choose between Positive and Negative ratings to indicate their overall evaluation sentiment.

- **Automated Form Filling:** The extension automatically populates the course evaluation form with predefined responses based on the selected mood.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The extension integrates seamlessly into the browser, providing a user-friendly interface for a more efficient evaluation process.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension on your browser.
2. Navigate to the course evaluation page on the Covenant University portal.
3. Click on the extension icon to open the interface.
4. Select your rating (Positive or Negative).
5. Click the "Fill Course Evaluation Form" button.
